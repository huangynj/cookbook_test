This Project Pythia–style cookbook provides practical, reproducible examples for working with scientific data and workflows in Python.  
The focus is on **hands-on notebooks** that demonstrate concepts step by step and can be run both online and locally.

---

## Motivation

The goal of this cookbook is to provide clear, executable examples that bridge theory and practice.  
By the end of the cookbook, readers will be able to:

- Understand the structure of a reproducible scientific workflow
- Run and modify Jupyter notebooks interactively
- Adapt the provided examples to their own research or applications

## Structure

This cookbook is organized into the following sections:

### 1. Foundations

This section introduces the core concepts, datasets, and Python tools used throughout the cookbook.  
It is intended to build the necessary background for the example workflows.

### 2. Example Workflows

This section contains complete, end-to-end notebook examples demonstrating how to apply the concepts introduced in the foundations section to real problems.

## Running the Notebooks

You can run the notebooks either **online using Binder** or **locally on your own machine**.

### Running on Binder

The simplest way to interact with the notebooks is through
[Binder](https://binder.projectpythia.org/).

1. Click the **Binder badge** at the top of this README
2. Wait for the environment to launch
3. Open a notebook and run cells using `Shift + Enter`

Binder allows you to execute and modify the notebooks without installing anything locally.

### Running on Your Own Machine

To run the notebooks locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/huangynj/cookbook_test.git
